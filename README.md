# Space-exploration-game

## About
Space Exploration is a fun, simple game I created just for the joy of coding and my love for space themes. It's a personal project that combines chance, resource management, and cosmic graphics.

## Game in a Nutshell
![](ISpace-exploration-game/screenshots/Screenshot4.png)
- Explore space sectors
- Manage your credits (fuel)
- Discover various space objects
- Try to increase your credits through exploration

## Why I Made This
I built this game purely for fun and to learn some Python. It was a great way to spend some free time and experiment with game development concepts. I used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th4OBktqK1I) by @techwithtim for inspiration.

## How to Play
1. Choose sectors to explore (1-3)
2. Set fuel amount per sector
3. Click "Explore Space"
4. See what you discover!

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Tkinter for GUI
